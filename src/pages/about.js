          Hi there. I am Ryan Dunn, a front-end developer from Manchester U.K.

        <p>
          My background is in design and e-commerce and my strengths currently
          lie in web and mobile applications using the React and React Native
          ecosystem. I love to create forward-thinking user experiences that are
          fast and accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have over ten years of real-world, problem-solving experience,
          working with clients such as eBay, Walls and the Royal Northern
          College of Music. I am experienced in architecting projects using
          modern front-end tools and techniques that solve problems efficiently.
          Frameworks, bundlers, pre-processors, linters, types, tests and
          pipelines are part of my day-to-day life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time I enjoy hiking, climbing, the outdoors, playing the
          guitar, and am a friend to dogs everywhere.
